GWAS Data Sources Documentation

Dataset Overview
This documentation describes the GWAS summary statistics used in the fine-mapping analysis of candidate causal cell types in solid cancers using cis-regulatory elements. The datasets span multiple cancer types with varying sample sizes and represent primarily European ancestry populations.

Quality Control Standards
We performed rigorous quality control to clean and harmonize each GWAS dataset. This involved removing sex chromosomal variants, multi-allelic SNPs, and ambiguous variants; filtering out variants with low imputation quality (INFO score < 0.9), rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] < 0.005 in the GWAS), variants with extreme effect sizes (|BETA| > 3), and variants with invalid P-values (P-value ≤ 0 or > 1); and removing duplicate entries from the datasets. Additionally, we harmonized all datasets to the hg19 genome build to ensure consistency across analyses. Finally, we aligned the datasets with the 1000G reference panel, excluding variants absent from the panel, variants with MAF < 0.005 in the reference panel, and variants exhibiting significant allele frequency discrepancies (MAF difference > 0.2) between the GWAS and reference panel populations.

Data Availability
All processed GWAS summary statistics data following quality control procedures have been uploaded to this repository, except for the two restricted access datasets (endometrial cancer and bladder cancer) which cannot be shared due to collaborative agreements and pending publication status.
